Quick Install
=============

branch=stable
host=vmhost.lan
ssh root@${host} bash -c "'(echo branch=${branch:=stable}; curl -o - http://github.com/jeffmccune/puppet-demotools/raw/${branch}/bin/rhel-vm-setup) | bash'"

Puppet Runtime
==============
In order to use the runtime, execute /demo/puppet-demotools/bin/puppet-runtime

A stable puppet runtime is provided in order to configure puppet
using puppet.  This runtime expects puppet to NOT be installed
into the ruby site directory.  If you have installed puppet packages,
it is a good idea to remove them as testing will be performed by managing
PATH and RUBYLIB environment variables.

To setup performance Testing
============================
1: /demo/puppet/demotools/bin/puppet-setup-testing
 * This script will setup everything needed in /opt/puppetlabs
2: TBD

For the demonstration
=====================
1: /demo/puppet-demotools/bin/puppet-setup-demo
2: /demo/puppet-demotools/bin/demo-puppetmasterd --reports=logversion,store
3: puppetd --test
4: View results in Splunk

Detailed Instructions
=====================

Install a new CentOS 5.5 system into a Virtual Machine

Optional: Update the SSH Public Key variable at the top of
modules/puppet-demo/manifests/init.pp

Optional: Update other variables in the module.

Copy rhel-vm-setup to the virtual machine.

Execute the rhel-vm-setup script with bash.

The rhel-vm-setup will:
* Install puppet from EPEL
* Install git
* Clone https://jeffmccune@github.com/jeffmccune/puppet-demotools.git
* Execute puppet-demotools/puppet-setup-demo

Debugging
=========
Ruby-debug is nice for debugging the log processors
This will help view available attributes and runtime
objects in ruby when the log is processed.

require 'rubygems'
require 'ruby-debug'; Debugger.start
...
debugger

Start puppetmasterd in the foreground with --no-daemonize

Interesting data in the log objects:
(rdb:70) ps log
