.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This is the standalone puppet execution tool; use it to execute
individual manifests that you write. If you need to execute site\-wide
manifests, use +puppetd+ and +puppetmasterd+.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
Note that any configuration parameter that\(aqs valid in the configuration
file is also a valid long argument. For example, \(aqssldir\(aq is a valid
configuration parameter, so you can specify \(aq\-\-ssldir <directory>\(aq as an
argument.
.sp
See the configuration file documentation at
\fI\%http://puppetlabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/ConfigurationReference\fP for the
full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with
\(aq\-\-genconfig\(aq.
.sp
debug:              Enable full debugging.

.TP
.B detailed\-exitcodes: Provide transaction information via exit codes. If
.
this is enabled, an exit code of \(aq2\(aq means there
were changes, and an exit code of \(aq4\(aq means that
there were failures during the transaction.

.TP
.B loadclasses:        Load any stored classes. +puppetd+ caches configured

classes (usually at /etc/puppet/classes.txt), and
setting this option causes all of those classes to
be set in your +puppet+ manifest.
.TP
.B logdest:            Where to send messages. Choose between syslog, the
.
console, and a log file. Defaults to sending
messages to the console.

.sp
execute:            Execute a specific piece of Puppet code
.sp
